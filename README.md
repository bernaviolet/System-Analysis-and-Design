# System-Analysis-and-Design

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass saw a need for driver training because many people fail their driving tests. DriverPass wanted me to develop a web-based system that would allow students to book lesson packages, take online classes, practice tests, and book in-person classes and driving lessons. 

# What did you do particularly well?
In this project I was able to understand what the client wanted from their program and interpret those needs into system requirements. I interpreted those needs in the system requirements document and I visually communicated them in the system design document. 

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
While I'm happy with the work I completed for the DriverPass project, if I could revise one area, I would refine the use case diagram so that it would be a bit easier to tell which actors and use cases interact. 

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs by paying attention to what the DriverPass team said they would need in the system. I also saw how DriverPass wanted the system to function for different types of users in the system. There are several different roles with different abilities in the program, each of those had to be implemented in the system design. It's important to consider the user's needs when designing the system because crucial areas of the program could be left out. For example, if the users weren't able to communicate with each other in the DriverPass program, their experience could become frustrating. Instead of having a program that meets all their needs, they might have to call DriverPass or go into a location to talk to an employee about their questions. While placing an extra call might not be too much of an inconvenience, it does make interacting with DriverPass more complicated for the user. 

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach designing software by understanding what the client and users need from the system. I want to know what the end goal of the system is, how they envision the look of the system, and any special features they would like the system to have. After I have this information I plan to build and test the system and give feedback to the client during the development process. Techniques and strategies I plan to use in the future are client and user interviews, user stories, and test cases after code has been written.
